## 👋 About Me

I'm a final-year B.Tech CSE student who enjoys working with data and backend systems.  
I like exploring how databases, queries, and structured workflows power real-world applications.  
I’m comfortable with SQL, Python and core computer science concepts, and I enjoy solving problems with logic and clarity.  
Currently focused on learning, building projects, and growing through hands-on experience in the IT domain.
